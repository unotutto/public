# Your Babysitter in Zug

---

Do you need to go shopping, visit the beauty salon, see a movie or simply meet with a friend, while you kids are having a wonderful time reading books, making origami or building with Lego? 

I would be delighted to help!

My name is Anna and I'm 13.
I love small kids and they always connect to me well.
I have completed a "Babysitting & Child Care Training" course by Red cross, and I practiced two full days at Kita.

I am at my second year at the Kanti Zug.
I am fluent in German (Swiss German), English and Russian, and speak French well too! _Helping with Languages - Easy!_

I love writing stories and have also won competitions on the subject.
Do you want you kids to be excited about reading? I would be there to help!

Math and computer science for primary school or any other kind of homework - also happy to support!

I could offer babysitting or homework support services on Wednesday afternoons, Friday evenings and during the weekend.

Looking forward to meet you and your little ones!

Anna
